        <p class="interview-info">
            We conducted interviews that included individuals who frequently consumed cup noodles and those who did not to get results outside of just the college student demographic. 
            Employing the master-apprentice model, our interviews were designed to allow participants to share their knowledge and experiences, turning them into 'teachers' during the 
            process. Using a combination of closed and open-ended questions, our interview approach aimed to uncover insights into common errors associated with the packaging of instant 
            ramen cups. Interview questions were split into pre-task, task, and post-task questions. 
        </p>

        <h6 class="interview-heading">Pre-Task</h6>
        <p class="interview-info">These questions allow us to gain a preliminary understanding of how familiar the interviewees are with instant ramen cups.</p>

        </ul>

        <h6 class="interview-heading">Tasks</h6>
        <p class="interview-info">We asked our interviewees to think out loud and walk us through their thought process as they completed the tasks below so that we could gather both qualitative and qualitative data. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How would you open the lid?</li>
            <li>Can you show us how you keep the lid closed while the noodles are cooking?</li>
            <li>Show how you normally eat the noodles. (sit on the couch holding the cup, on a table etc.)</li>

        <h6 class="trends-heading">Trends</h6>
        <p class="trends-info">
            There are several trends and patterns we observed while analyzing the data from the interviews. 9 out of 18 participants stated that they consume cup noodles roughly a few times a week, 4 out of 
            18 participants said they consume cup noodles a few times a month, while 5 out of 18 participants said they consume cup noodles a few times a year. 
        </p>
        <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="trends-info">
            In addition, we noticed that 16 out of 18 of our interviewees did not look at the instructions on the packaging before preparing the noodles indicating to us that the packaging of the noodles has 
            enough signifiers and constraints for users to have a clear mental model of how to prepare their noodles. 
            However, we noticed that 4 out of 18 participants opened the lid too wide. Brands generally suggest people open it halfway so that they can seal it for the noodles to cook 
            but we noticed users also struggled to keep the lid closed after opening. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="trends-heading">Trade-Offs</h6>
        <p class="trends-info">
            We analyzed the different types of cup noodles interviewees consume and how they interacted with the design of the cup. One significant trade-off we noticed was durability vs cost. 
            Materials that cost less allow for more affordable prices. However, the reduction in price compromises the quality of the material used. Our data supports this finding since 9 out of the 18 ranked the durability between a 1-5. 
            Cup noodles that are priced less might be more convenient for the user, but they also break more easily, and are more susceptible to errors. 
        </p>
        <p class="trends-info">
            Safety vs efficiency is another trade-off. 6 out of the 18 interviewees had mentioned how hot the cup got. If an error were to occur such as touching the cup too soon or accidentally overpouring the water, the user is susceptible 
            to injuring themselves through burns. However, the efficiency of making a cup of ramen takes little to no effort and minimal time. These problems that may occur during the process can cause injury so adding safety components like a sleeve 
            or a constraint for the lid may be beneficial for the user, but with the caveat that the process becomes less efficient due to the increase of steps and time.

    <!-- prototype  -->
    <div class="low-fidelity-prototype white-background">
        <h5 class="box">Prototype</h5>
        <p class="design-info">
            After analyzing our results and identifying common problems our users faced, we proposed some redesign ideas for cup noodles using the double diamond method. 
            One of the common problems we wanted to fix was the overall material and durability of the cup itself while also keeping costs in mind.
        </p>
        <h6 class="space-heading">First Interation:</h6>
        <p class="design-info">
            In the first iteration, we wanted to implement a thicker material for the cup so that it’s more durable and easier for users to hold. During our interviews, we asked users to rate how hot they thought the cup noodles felt on a scale of 1 to 10. The average response from our 18 interviewees was approximately 7.2, indicating a relatively high level of heat experienced by users with 6 out of 18 users reporting a 9 out of 10. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="space-heading">Second Interation:</h6>
        <p class="design-info">
            Although implementing a thicker cup will solve our problem in terms of the overall hotness of the cup, it would require us to produce a whole new version of the cup. 
            Taking this into consideration, in the second iteration of our redesign process, we thought it would be a better idea to add something to the original design of the cup rather 
            than starting from scratch. During this iteration, we focused on exploring items that we saw commonly used with hot items such as hot foods and coffee. We wanted to find a solution 
            to help with the excessive heat in cup noodles. We noticed that coffee cups and cup noodles share similar qualities as they both afford holding when the contents of the cups are steaming hot. 
            However, with 6 out of 18 participants stating that the cups were at a 9-hotness level, it’s clear that holding the cup while the noodles are cooking is a problem. 
        </p>
        <p class="design-info">
            One of the added features that particularly stood out to us was the cardboard sleeve that is attached to the hot coffee. The addition of the sleeve makes it easier for users to 
            hold the hot cup improving their overall experience with the hot item. As inspiration, we thought it would be best to incorporate a non-conductive heating sleeve instead of a thicker cup. This will help cut down the costs of the 
            redesign since we won’t have to change the design of the current cups. There are also many different types of cup noodles so it would require us to change the material for every brand which is time-consuming as well. 
            In addition, this will be more environmentally friendly since the sleeves can be reusable and will be made out of cardboard instead of your typical styrofoam cup. Furthermore, the added sleeve will make the overall cup more durable, 
            to mitigate against capture slips of squeezing the cup too hard and crushing the material. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="space-heading">Final Interation:</h6>
        <p class="design-info">
            In the final iteration of our redesign process, we wanted to redesign the lid of the cup so that it could afford to close while cooking and have a constraint that would prevent users from easily ripping off the lid entirely. 
            One of the common trends we noticed when our interviewees were opening the product was that 4 out of 18 of them opened the lid too much and 3 out of 18 participants didn’t know that the lid was supposed to stay closed to 
            facilitate cooking. We added a constraint on the lid that would prevent users from ripping the lid all the way off. The way this constraint would work is for the first half of the lid (shaded in gray) to easily come off the way 
            it’s currently designed. After the noodles are done, the user will have to pull with some force to get the rest of the lid off. The idea is that the second half of the lid has slightly more resistance to pulling to help prevent 
            description-similarity slips of ripping the lid off all the way.
        </p>
        <p class="design-info">
            We also noticed that once the lid is opened, it does not afford closing which affects the cooking process since the heat can easily escape. To tackle this problem, we decided that it would be best to implement adhesive 
            lids that have re-stick tabs. The re-stick tabs will act as signifiers, especially because they will be in a different color (blue) for users to let them know that the cup affords to seal. The adhesive lids will allow 
            users to seal the cup while the noodles are cooking without having to add anything on top of the lid and it simplifies the overall lid removal process. This redesign idea aims to provide users with an easier way of 
            opening and sealing the lid for cooking, enhancing their experience with the process. 
        </p>
        <p class="design-info">
            Redesigning cup noodles by adding the non-conductive heating sleeves, a constrained lid, and the re-stick tabs will help with the hotness of the cup. The sleeves will act as a barrier between the user’s hand and the 
            hot cup reducing the discomfort they experience while holding the hot cup and improving their overall experience with eating cup noodles. Furthermore, the re-stick tabs have more signifiers and affordances than the 
            current lid which allows our users to seal their lid while the noodles are cooking. Being able to seal the lid back up helps trap the steam within the cup so that the noodles can cook thoroughly. Incorporating the sleeves, 
            re-stick tabs, and the outer rim will help improve the safety of users and their overall experience with the product as efficiency improves.

    <!-- redesign tradeoffs  -->
    <div class="redesign-tradeoff gray-back">
        <h5 class="box">Redesign Trade-Offs</h5>
        <p class="design-info">
            One tradeoff associated with our redesign includes costs and sustainability. We noticed that using sustainable and environmentally friendly materials was one of the concerns some of our users had so we tried our best to 
            redesign the cup noodles with that in mind. Although we plan on making the sleeves out of cardboard which is one of the most sustainable materials, there are still limitations in terms of its recyclability and environmental 
            impact. Cardboard is easily recyclable but some factors can affect its recyclability such as contaminated products. Additionally, the production process for cardboard sleeves may require energy and resources, which can affect 
            its environmental footprint and the production price. Circling back to the aforementioned design space chart adding a sleeve will make the cup more durable. However, it will also sacrifice cost for that feature. This feature 
            will also improve the safety of the cup but will sacrifice efficiency because it adds more steps.
        </p>
        <p class="design-info">
            In terms of the re-stick tabs, one of the potential trade-offs associated with this is the cost for durability and overall quality of the tabs. As per usual, the better the quality, the more expensive it will be. 
            With a limited budget, there could be potential compromises when it comes to the re-stick tabs. For example, the strength of the tabs will be dependent on the overall quality of the tabs, and subsequently cost. If the tab was 
            lifted and resealed multiple times, the adhesive on the tabs will become less and less effective over time impacting the reliability of the seal. However, we’re not too concerned with this since these are pretty much single-use cups 
            anyway. Overall, the tradeoff associated with re-stick tabs is connected between the cost and the adhesive's strength and durability.

    <!-- conclusion  -->
    <div class="conclusion white-background">
        <h5 class="box">Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="testing-info">
            To summarize our findings, by analyzing the cup of ramen through the lens of <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, we found several errors that impact the user experience. 
            The cup of instant ramen, while convenient and well-liked, exhibits several design flaws that impact the overall user experience. Through our interviews that were conducted 
            with the master-apprentice model, we were able to analyze qualitative and quantitative data from our participants and found that our participants did not find the cups very 
            durable and subsequently thought the cups were very hot to the touch. Furthermore, many of our participants had issues with the lid of the instant ramen cups. These problems 
            were then linked to common errors such as knowledge-based mistakes and description-similarity slips through the lack of signifiers and anti-affordances. Through our proposed 
            redesign, we hoped to mitigate those errors and solve these problems.
        </p>
        <p class="testing-info">
            Using the double-diamond method, our team decided that the final redesign would improve upon the cup itself and the instant ramen lids due to the problems our participants 
            named. Our redesign includes adding a cup sleeve, constraining the lid, and adding re-stick tabs to the lid of the instant ramen to make them adhesive. We found that remodeling 
            the cup entirely with a thicker material to allow users to hold the cup while it’s hot is a bit excessive so we found a better alternative in the cup sleeve. This way, it adds 
            more insulation and decreases the likelihood of burns or spills. Adhesive lids improve the sealing mechanism and decrease the chances of of splashes of hot water/steam escaping from the cup.

        <p class="testing-info">
            If we were able to continue this project, a series of steps would occur next. First, we would prototype our redesign and meet with the companies with the most market share of 
            instant ramen cups to see if this is easily manufacturable. These meetings would include discussions of pricing and timelines. We would then like to share this prototype with 
            a focus group to see if this redesign would be well-received if the company went ahead and added these features to their instant ramen cups. If these steps go over smoothly, 
            we would want to standardize this design across all brands so that instant ramen cups are more durable and safe for users to enjoy their noodles in.
