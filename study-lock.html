        <p class="overview-info">My research question for this project focused on examining how sleeping past 4 A.M. can impacts an individual's productivity and energy levels throughout the day. I wanted 
            to observe the correlation between an individual's energy levels, productivity, and the time at which they sleep. Since it's difficult to observe individuals for the entirety of their day, I decided to observe them through
            increments of their day.
        </p>
        <p class="overview-info">The main motivation behind this project was to identify different strategies aimed at improving user productivity, taking into account technology's influence on today's society.

        <h6 class="objectives-heading">User Needs</h6>
        <p class="objectives-info">To start this project, I began with a needfinding observation. Given the potential privacy intrusions of this project,
            I opted to observe a friend to avoid making other individuals uncomfortable. Throughout the observations, I noticed that my subject consistently exhibited 
            signs of distraction, frequently reaching for her phone. I also noticed that her focus levels fluctuated, with specific environments, such as her home, 
            appearing to enhance concentration and productivity. After analyzing my observations, the two needs that stood out most to me include: 
            Users need to eliminate all distractions for optimal work performance, and Users need a safe and comfortable environment to work. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="objectives-heading">Ideation: Brainstorming Solutions</h6>
        <p class="objectives-info">Some ideas I came up with using mindmapping, reverse thinking, and challenging assumptions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organize and Remove potential distractions from workspace.</li>
            <li>Work in quiet areas.</li>
            <li>Put all common distractors in workspace. (reverse thinking)</li>
            <li>Being on your phone is not considered as being productive.</li>
            <li>A messy workspace is a distraction.</li>
            <li>Nightowls need at least 8 hours of sleep in order to be productive throughout the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="objectives-info">Considering the widespread use of technology, I wanted to create a solution that reduces the amount of time users spend on their phone 
            while trying to complete work. This led me to StudyLock! An app that allows you to temporarily disable specific apps of your choosing, promoting a focused and productive work environment.

        <p class="testing-info">
            I created a user test in the form of a survey to collect insights that will help enhance my app. I began with having users 
            run through the interactions of my prototype on Figma and mess around with the features of the app. I noted that not all features of the app are 
            fully implemented. After interacting with the app, I had my users answer questions about their experience followed with a few 
            demographic questions. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="testing-info">
            Below is a list of some of the questions: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Were you able to understand the purpose of this app based on the pages you saw?</li>
            <li>How often do you get distracted while doing work/studying?</li>
            <li>On average, how many hours do you spend on your phone per day?</li>
            <li>How easy was it to unlock your apps when you're in study mode? 1 - very hard | 5 - very easy</li>
            <li>Did you understand the purpose of 'Master Unlock'?</li>
            <li>Tell us a little about your experience with the app. (describe difficulties, if any)</li>
            <li>What is your opinion about the organization of information on the screen?</li>
            <li>Were there any features/functionalities that you expected to find in a study lock app but did not? If yes, please describe them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6 class="testing-header">Feedback</h6>
        <p class="testing-info">
            I received a lot of positive feedback from my survey with users noting that they understood the app's purpose and found ease in navigating to specific features.  
            Users also mentioned that the color scheme was light and calming and the design was simple and intuitive. 
        </p>
        <p class="testing-info">
            My users provided constructive feedback suggesting a few minor adjustments. They suggested I add task descriptions, a smaller bottom navigation bar, and
            modify the appearance of the timer screen once it's started. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="testing-header">Future Implementations</h6>
        <p class="testing-info">
            If I had more time for this project, I would work on refining the interactions on my prototype, implement user feedback, and finish the settings screen. 
            One of the bigger features I would change is where the timer settings are displayed.  Instead of having it in the productivity tab, I would like to move it to the timer 
            section on the home screen making it easily accessible. I chose to implement 
            the main features of the app (timer, home screen, tasks, master unlock, etc.) to help users understand the purpose of the app. I spent the majority of the time designing 
            the home screen and productivity screen and did not have much time for the rewards and setting screens.
